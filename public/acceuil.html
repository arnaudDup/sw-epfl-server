                The main idea of the project is to connect people through music. The concept will be simple, as you launch the app, you’ll be able to chose between different music player you have on your device (Spotify, …). Everytime you’ll start to listening some of your songs, the app will add your choice to your personal list. The idea is to use geo-localisation and this list of preferences to match the taste of music from people around you. We want to use those informations to make people interact with each others depending on their taste. We will show on the interface a list (filtered and sorted) of the other users with the biggest affinity. The ones with the biggest affinity will be chosen from the music affinity/distance ratio.
                The user will be able to chose the radius of search around him. We want to ease the introduction to new people for the user while allowing him to listening to his music.</p>

                  The main goal of our project is to connect people through music and break the ice between people who share the same music taste. The implementation of this project will be simple. When the user launches our application and wants to listen to music, we will give them the option to play their music from the different kinds of media players they might have on their device (Spotify, Google Play Music etc.). The app will mostly run in background. Once they have chosen the music they want to listen to, we will save their preference and bind it to their account (to which they will login via Facebook). The main idea is to use GPS to find the location of our current user, and then match the current user’s music taste with the other users who are located close. The user will be given a list of the people around them who have a similar taste in music. This list will be sorted depending on the (similarity in music taste/distance) ratio in order to provide the best user experience. Hopefully, in the end we will have an application that makes it easier for people to socialize with others who share the same music taste.  <br>
